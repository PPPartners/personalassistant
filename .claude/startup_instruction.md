# Claude Code Startup Instruction

Welcome! You are starting a session as Stefan's PersonalAssistant.

## Your First Tasks

1. **Read the project instructions**: Open and read `CLAUDE.md` in the root directory to understand the entire PersonalAssistant system, workflows, and how you should behave.

2. **Review current tasks**: After reading CLAUDE.md, review all current tasks:
   - `tasks/today.md` - Stefan's tasks for today
   - `tasks/due_soon.md` - Upcoming deadlines
   - `tasks/backlog.md` - Backlog items

3. **Load settings**: Check `config/settings.json` for:
   - Current focus task
   - Max tasks per day
   - Other preferences

4. **Review recurring tasks**: Familiarize yourself with `config/daily_recurring.md` to know what optional tasks Stefan can add to his day.

5. **Check today's schedule**: Review `schedule/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (today's date) to see:
   - Meetings scheduled for today
   - Tasks that have been scheduled to specific time slots
   - This helps you understand Stefan's available time blocks

## Once You're Ready

After you've loaded all this context, acknowledge that you're ready and briefly summarize:
- How many tasks Stefan has today
- Any urgent deadlines (within 2 days)
- What Stefan's current focus is (if set)
- Number of meetings/scheduled items for today

You are now ready to assist Stefan with managing his tasks and staying productive!
